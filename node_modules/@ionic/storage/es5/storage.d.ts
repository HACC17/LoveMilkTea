/**
 * Storage is an easy way to store key/value pairs and JSON objects.
 * Storage uses a variety of storage engines underneath, picking the best one available
 * depending on the platform.
 *
 * When running in a native app context, Storage will prioritize using SQLite, as it's one of
 * the most stable and widely used file-based databases, and avoids some of the
 * pitfalls of things like localstorage and IndexedDB, such as the OS deciding to clear out such
 * data in low disk-space situations.
 *
 * When running in the web or as a Progressive Web App, Storage will attempt to use
 * IndexedDB, WebSQL, and localstorage, in that order.
 *
 * @usage
 * First, if you'd like to use SQLite, install the cordova-sqlite-storage plugin:
 * ```bash
 * cordova plugin add cordova-sqlite-storage --save
 * ```
 *
 * Next, install the package (comes by default for Ionic 2 apps >= RC.0)
 *
 * ```bash
 * npm install --save @ionic/storage
 * ```
 *
 * Next, add it to the imports list in your `NgModule` declaration (for example, in `src/app.module.ts`):
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { IonicStorageModule } from '@ionic/storage';
 *
 * @NgModule({
 *   declarations: [
 *     // ...
 *   ],
 *   imports: [
 *     IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp),
 *     IonicStorageModule.forRoot()
 *   ],
 *   bootstrap: [IonicApp],
 *   entryComponents: [
 *     // ...
 *   ],
 *   providers: []
 * })
 * export class AppModule {}
 *```
 *
 * Finally, inject it into any of your components or pages:
 * ```typescript
 * import { Storage } from '@ionic/storage';

 * export class MyApp {
 *   constructor(storage: Storage) {
 *
 *      storage.ready().then(() => {
 *
 *        // set a key/value
 *        storage.set('name', 'Max');
 *
 *        // Or to get a key/value pair
 *        storage.get('age').then((val) => {
 *          console.log('Your age is', val);
 *        })
 *      });
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Configuring Storage
 *
 * The Storage engine can be configured both with specific storage engine priorities, or custom configuration
 * options to pass to localForage. See the localForage config docs for possible options: https://github.com/localForage/localForage#configuration
 *
 * Note: Any custom configurations will be merged with the default configuration
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { IonicStorageModule } from '@ionic/storage';
 *
 * export function provideStorage() {
 *   return new Storage({ name: '__mydb' });
 * }
 *
 * @NgModule({
 *   declarations: ...,
 *   imports: [
 *     IonicStorageModule.forRoot({ useFactory: provideStorage })
 *   ],
 *   bootstrap: ...,
 *   entryComponents: ...,
 *    providers: []
 * })
 * export class AppModule {}
 * ```
